# Functional Programming

- [Procedures, Functions, Data](https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/procedures-functions-data)
  Outside of Eric Normand's [still in progress book] _Grokking Simplicity_ this is, sadly and shockingly, the _only_ other accessible example of utilizing functional programming concepts in real-world JavaScript code I've found. Mr. Smith leads you step-by-step from procedural (read: imperative) syntax to functional; thus achieving an example of what Hillel Wayne calls a ["persuasive"](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/persuasive-examples/) (vs "instrucive"): a more difficult, but helpful kind.

# React

- [React Patterns](https://reactpatterns.com/)

  It's like the Gang of Four but for React, and written with less an air of thought-leadery importance. I wrote React for almost two years without finding this site and I feel great _saudade_ for that time.

  Developing this instinct really takes time. But this article from Kent is a nice guide to help you wrangle your test code to focus on the end user experience. It's also effectively an advertisement for principles that drove the design of React Testing Library, and how it saves you from the kind of gunfooting allowed by Enzyme. A great companion piece to [Avoid the Test User](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user).
