		<h1>Hi Ripple. Here are a few examples of my work at Zendesk.</h1>

		<h3>The Zendesk Benchmark Page</h3>
		<a href="http://www.zendesk.com/benchmark-your-support">zendesk.com/benchmark-your-support</a> | <a href="https://gist.github.com/rosschapman/6783165">gist</a>
		<p>After being handed a flat file from Creative, I spruced up this page in the browser with an onload <a href="https://gist.github.com/rosschapman/6783165">animation</a> to "rev-up" the user, as well as Vegas-ify the Benchmark data table with a slot-machine effect.  The data displayed on the page is fetched by an AJAX call from a Google Spreadsheet (Google Data API) - not the best data-store but a stop-gap solution at the time because that's where the Product data team put it.  Also, it's subtle, but the Global Benchmark numbers are dynamic data so the numerals are actually loaded from a sprite. </p>

		<h3>Internationalization</h3>
		<li><a href="http://ja.zendesk.com/">ja.zendesk.com</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://de.zendesk.com/">de.zendesk.com</a></li>
		<li><a class="link" href="http://fr.zendesk.com">fr.zendesk.com</a></li>
		<p>You'll notice design/UI parity on most landing pages across our English site and localized sites.  This is made possible by leveraging native WordPress frameworks and APIs like the multi-site network, child themes, and the GNU gettext libraries baked into WordPress core. By using gettext we were able to abstract our translation files from our templates, which allowed the team to roll out new landing pages to our localized sites rapidly, and even train less technical team members to make translation edits in GUI tools for Mac.</p>

		<h3>Sitewide Search</h3>

		<p>Zendesk is a product used by a wide spectrum of industries and company types.  The feature set and benefits are complex so the messaging is fractured across dozens of landing pages on the corporate website. In an effort to provide the user with a simpler way to get information quickly about our product, I redesigned and <a href="https://gist.github.com/rosschapman/11cd1cda4d9ad57057a9">developed</a> our sitewide search to be unobtrusively accessible from the top navigation.  It can also be toggled by typing the "s" key.  I also added autocomplete which does regex matching with a jQuery plugin against a common index of terms researched from Google Analytics.  Results are fetched by an AJAX call to the Google Search Engine API on ENTER; what's more, the results will persist during the session if the user activates the search bar again.</p>

		<h3>Zendesk Apps</h3>
		<a href="http://www.zendesk.com/apps">zendesk.com/apps</a> | <a href="https://gist.github.com/rosschapman/6782490">gist</a> | <a href="https://gist.github.com/rosschapman/20cf591554c7393ef133">gist</a>
		<p>Creative was swamped so I designed the UI for the single app pages - click "Learn More" on any tile to view.  Underneath the hood there is actually a custom template routing <a href="https://gist.github.com/rosschapman/6782490">plugin</a> I wrote in PHP that dynamically builds the page based on the URI request - these pages are not stored in the MySQL database because the data comes from the Zendesk product!  Data is actually stored in a JSON file that we update periodically with a Grunt.js <a href="https://gist.github.com/rosschapman/20cf591554c7393ef133">task</a> during development.</p>

		<h3>BONUS: CSS/JS Minification and Cache Busting</h3>
		<p>In the source code you'll notice hashes and a ".min" suffix on our externally-loaded CSS and JavaScript files.  I implemented a set of Grunt.js tasks to minify and hash files, and then make replacements throughout our WordPress templates.</p>
