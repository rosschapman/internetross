<h1>The story</h1>
<p>Smart customer service strategy requires a blend of tactics, from automated issue deflection (macros, triggers, etc...) to live chat support.  While Zendesk was a disruptive software in that it centralized the administration of these tactics in a modern, "designed for humans" interface, the software was still feature rich to serve a variety of use cases and needs.  Successfully marketing the software as "simple" - a brand cornerstone - was always a challenge in constructing a focused narrative.  It was a beautifully simple UI with enterprise-level business logic powering advanced features.</p>

<p>The dance between simple and sophisticated impacted discussions about our website IA.  I can remember an almost seasonal cyclical debate about surfacing landing pages and long-tail content that would get buried in sub-sections and the blog archives.  Similarly, over time the site navigation became a heavy spread of nested dropdowns that would top 8 links.  It's not terrible when you nav gets like this, but at least why not add some kind of modern <i>find </i>mechanism on your pages.</p>

<p>Leading up to this project I was developing an urge to elevate our search once again to the header of our website documents - it was presently buried in the footer as a simple text field.  In so many ways these days we are "search first" users.  Not as prominently on desktop as on mobile, but we should seek to make search available in prime real-estate if we can.  I believe so because 1) it is an interactive experience we can delight the user with while they easily find what they need, and 2) we can get data about what users need or can't find on our website.</p>

<p>I can't remember exactly how it came together but the web production team and creative had been talking about a collabo for a minute. Particularly trying to deliver a new feature quickly, like in two days - design one day and build/ship the next.  So we went for it!  And we hadn't done something like this before.  I led the charge on this one, quickly soliciting and recruiting a team member (with our project manager's blessing) and shortly we were sitting at Sightglass sketching.  The roast vapor and smooth counter of reclaimed-ish redwood-ish buttressed our inspiration.  I really recommend teams try this kind of lightening project.  Not necessarily on a whim.  But when you've plugged away at the primary queue for a while it can be a really nice refresher to step aside and get at a thing that's been bugging you or a side project where you want to push your learning edge.</p>
