                <h2>Too many imports</h2>
                <h3>Tags: javascript, react, refactoring</h3>
            </header>
            <p>There are too many imports in this file. I'm staring down like 50 lines of imports. External
                libraries (React, Lodash, etc...), to our own internal libraries, to components, to helpers, to
                constants. The last bothers me the most because they feel like implementation details I want hidden
                away in these other components or helpers.</p>
            <p>And as am I'm looking at this statement inside a <code>render()</code> block:</p>
            <p><code>const currentStatus = this.props.statusType == SOLD_OUT</code></p>
            <p>I'm suddenly reminded of what @getify told me on twitter a couple weeks ago: &quot;in 'functional
                programming', we love and embrace functions! functions everywhere!&quot;&lt;sup&gt;<a
                    href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1123408796276142080">ðŸ”—</a>&lt;/sup&gt; That's it, that's my
                out.</p>
            <p><code>const currentStatus = getStatusType(this.props.statusType)</code></p>
            <p>I can refactor this down to a data utility. And though I'm not cutting down the number of imports, I'm
                perhaps doing a few other useful things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cutting down the number of imports from <em>different</em> files</li>
                <li>Creating a reusable abstraction -- which I know can be employed elsewhere</li>
                <li>De-cluttering <code>render()</code> which makes integration tests simpler, possibly unnecessary for
                    some
                    cases since logic can be independently unit tested</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That last point is important. At least to me. Untidy <code>render()</code> blocks are hard to grok,
                debug, and
                test. A lot of the figuring out how to construct and compose the things to render can happen in
                other places: above the component class definition, in class methods, or in another file. The first
                options is one I quite like because abstractions don't have to be all that general. It's great if
                they are localized to the component at hand.</p>

                Read <a href="https://www.toptal.com/python/python-parameterized-design-patterns">Ensuring Clean Code: A
                    Look at Python, Parameterized</a> this morning. Parameters as DI! So yeah, now that we have default
                parameters in JavaScript -- as of ES6 -- we can think of parameterized DI for JS too; right there in our
                function declarations. This is super familiar if you're coming from JS where funcs are first class.
