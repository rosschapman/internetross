Welcome to the cryo-chamber for my erstwhile Backbone.js website.  When I built this thing in the fall of '13, it was my first formal adventure into MVC - though Backbone is really more MV*-style.  I wrote a little bit about it [here](http://internetross.me/jekyll-sunk-your-backbone-ship/) if you're interested. The codes are ok. I whipped this thing together right quick and was just getting my hands dirty in JavaScript application design for the first time. But it works, man! It works. And I think the design was pretty tight.
