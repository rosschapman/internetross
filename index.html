      <p>Hey all! <img class="shake" src="/assets/images/hello.png" height="25" style="position: relative; top: 3px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" alt="hand wave icon"> I'm Ross Chapman. I'm a software engineer that likes building useful things, collaboration in software systems, and the semiotics of <em>code</em>.   
      
      <p>I started as a website manager in digital marketing in 2010 and since 2014 have been working as a web application engineer - so about 10 years doing internet-y things. During that time I've worked in startups from series A to IPO, and am equally excited to work on teams large or small coding somewhere strategic between back and front. 

      <p>Semi-frequently I <a href="https://internetross.micro.blog/archive/">journal</a> <img src="/assets/images/write.png" height="25" style="position: relative; top: 3px; margin-right: 1px;" alt="hand writing icon"> about the human and technology parts of being a professional coder. Check out my fave industry <a href="/blogroll">writers</a> and <a href="https://internetross.micro.blog/hyperlinks/">posts</a> that influence my approach to writing software.

For 2+ years I've mentored  early-career software engineers both in a formal company setting, as co-founder of a bi-monthly in-person gathering, and most recently with the summer 2020 cohort of <a href="https://codecooperative.org/">Code Cooperative</a>.
