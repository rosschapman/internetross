         <p>Hey y'all, I'm Ross.</p>
        
          <p>Currently based in San Francisco building parts of the internet, deep in this trillicon valley zeitgeist. Orignally from the city of Chicago. Raised on 90s Bulls and bday parties playing multiplayer arcade boxes at Dennis' Place for Games. Less of a gamer now, more of <a href="http://pgbsf.org/">kung fu dude</a> in my spare time. Though recently played Zelda on Nintendo Switch and I mayyyy have to hit restart on that. You'll also find me around town hosting a private small code club for other web dev job seekers (holler if your'e interested!), showing up for URMs in our industry at <a href="https://techtonica.org/">Techtonica</a>, or pretending to move to New York every 6 months.</p>
          
          <p>Nice to meet you! Now what else to share in this perhaps not-so-laconic one-sheeter of a bildungsroman?</p>

          <h2>A little about professional me</h2>

          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgCvjppDwN8?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p>Why do I make the internet for a living? I'd posit it may have been the adventurous info hunting of hyperlinked documents I first encountered in Microsoft Encarta as a kid; being able to control playback of that bald eagle swoop down for that fish; jump to other pages with even more videos; so cool. Another possibility: it was that deep space of anything goes while the cursor blinked at the DOS prompt on my Dad's Apple IIe. Like, maybe I could really do crazy stuff with this interactive tv. I seriously got excited over simple stuff like initializing programs and traversing directory trees. (I also played a ton of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble">Bubble Bobble</a>.) Another key moment may have been ~1999, when I was a senior in high school. I edited an eBay web page during a summer internship. Just changed some font sizes and colors. But it was soooo satisfying to see those changes go live so instantaneously.</p>

          <p>Alas, I had an artistic side too. And that side just got more love through my teens and the college years. If you had asked me at 12 years old, bent over a sketch book contouring charcoal nudes in one of the seeming infinite halls of the Art Institute: hey kid, what do you want to be when you grow up? I'd probably reply, shyly, something like: a loose t-shirt wearing painter sitting around in European cafes in the 1920s. Shakespeare & Co. or what have you.</p>
          
          <p>Always a bit of a romantic.</p>

          <p>Fast forward a bit to college. Another key moment: the mind explosion when I saw the ILOVEYOU worm corrupt a hard-drive in real-time at a gallery put on by the Watson Institute's <a href="http://www.infopeace.org/ppn/">InfoTechWarPeace project</a> where I interned. You might say I was getting seriously wooed by hacker advances. (And falling a bit, too, for the dashing deutsche curator of that show, Franziska Nori).</p>

          <p>Then I touched down in the Yay Area in 2007, a couple years after college with experience in organic food notched to my belt. At this touchpoint of Valley history Twitter was a year launched and the SaaS bookmark service wars were reaching crescendo (do you remember???). It was practically inevitable to jack in during those times. Peeps at a networking function: what can you do [on the computer]? Me: well I've built a couple websites?? The way their eyes would just light up...</p>

          <p>In 2013 I got my first job building web applications at Science Exchange. Interestingly, at that moment I was a bit ambivallent about continuing to be paid to give computers instructions. I even went through a product <i>design</i> interview process with another small company at the time called Ripple (now not so small).</p>
          
          <p>But as fate would have it, at Science Exchange I worked with some amazeball folks who's overall stokedness about web dev wired the boring and hard stuff into my curiosity drive. And then there was joy of software teams: lunch and learns, conference field trips, book club, the spirited architectural design debates. I came to understand that I loves me some ridiculous optimism and enthusiasm and obsession with building castles of air with people. I'm not looking back.</p>

          <p>And so here we are. After some initial clogs, flirts, and fancies with the web, I'm like ~7 years into a professional career designing, developing, and debugging useful web things. Suddenly you look up from Land of Lisp and it's like whoa. This shit is great. I'm totally I/O bound and hanging ten on the info highway. It suits me well as a ravenous learner, I think. And romantic optimist about the power of the web. This is a heady existence of exponentializing ahas and obsessions and happy wtfs as you go deeper and follow the rhizomatic spread into things that empower so many things. The implicit return? Any given day I'm caring more than I ever thought I would about so many technical things.</p>
          
          <p>Higher order funcs and how functional is cool but like it feels awkward to say the word "pure" so much, ActiveRecord or DataMapper, tryna use this 418 status code, when REST breaks down, empathetic teams, fucking CORS, URLs ARE IMPORTANT, how ad-driven web is sad, sharing state in complex single page apps, the emotional side of technical debt, to Flow?, code reviews for teams not for speed, battling imposter syndrome, wait is this agile?, parameterized queries, discovering the right metaphors to describe what I'm actually doing, studying Martin Fowler, Aditya Bhargava, Kyle Simpson, Sandi Metz, and more.</p>

          <h2>I do like writing</h2>

          <p>Learning never stops in the software biz. Technology change is a constant. Our community and industry is really excited about how to get better. Gordon Moore is forcing things along hella fast and you gotta keep up. (Or was it Fred Moore?)</p>

          <p>Many coders fold this learning back into code in the form of side projects; always the bricoleurs. I've found writing to be a satisfying outlet for working over the TILs--though I did <a href="https://github.com/rosschapman/if-ross-wrote-javascript">hack a bit of node</a> recently to spread my JavaScript wings to the server. In many ways I write for me, and that's why some of my phrasing reads like e.e. cummings, or me after a couple pinots. But I do keep you in mind. Although I imagine you as someone who writes some code or helps build web products in some fashion. If you want to keep going, here's a sample of what I might call my professional web dev diary (with the whole rest of the lot <a href="https://medium.com/@internetross">here</a>):</p>
