          <h2>Who the actual</h2>

          <p>Hiiii, I'm Ross.</p>

          <p>...a boy who never really left Dennis' Place for Games. Y'all know <a href="https://www.timeout.com/chicago/shopping/gone-but-not-forgotten-stores-and-one-arcade">Dennis'</a>? It was the spot where I had bday parties as a kid and <i>who cares about cake Mom we're in the middle of beating the game, ugghhhh</i>. Team beat 'em ups for us 80s babes all day.</p>

          <p>Native Chicagoan, kindled by Jordan and Pippen till we singularity. Kindled later in life by Hui Neng and open source contribs. Currently based in San Francisco. But I pretend to move to New York every 6 months or so.</p>

          <p>What else in this not-so-laconic one-sheeter of a bildungsroman.

          <h2><a name="internetross"></a>internet (professional) ross</h2>

          <p>I make websites professionally for a living because I was seduced by the promise of hyperlinked documents I first navigated in Microsoft Encarta mebbe??</p> 

          <p>At this very mo' I'm seeking a new jobby job at a place to stretch my legs as a product engineer. More generally I'm pondering Jaron Lanier's reminder Google only matters because we screwed up Ted Nelson's two-way Xanadu. Or thinking about how worker owned coops might be better for democracy than blockchain.</p>

          <p>So, yeah, web. My first job building web product was working for Science Exchange, which really set me on this career path for serious. This was around 2013 and I wasn't sure at all if I wanted to continue being paid to give computers instructions. I was even interviewing for product design gigs. But as fate would have it, I had the fortune to be picked up by a small startup called Science Exchange where I worked with a couple amazeballs folks who were soooo stoked about web dev they made all the boring and hard parts not boring and hard. I guess I loves me some ridiculous optimism and enthusiasm and obsession with building castles of air. I guess I never should have underestimated the reward of <i>getting it to work</i>. Science Exchange was def my come up in this trillicon zeitgest, and I got to realize complex UX on the popular RJCHM (rəjēCHəm) stack -- you know the one, ♦️️, JS, CSS, HTML, MySQL -- for info highway passengers getting real work done.</p>

          <b>But all your friends' parents thought you'd be an actor or artist or something?</b>

          <p>Errm...I took the long way to get here. Perhaps because I'm from the last generation of patient people. Idk, a linear life paths was not for me.</p>

          <p>But yeah, developer/programmer wasn't my first <em>what I want to be when I grow up</em> idea. When I was a 12 year-old kid sketching charcoal nudes at the Art Institute, I dreamed my future self a loose t-shirt wearing painter sitting around in European cafes in the 1920s. Shakespeare & Co. or what have you.

          <p>In summer, of course. The loosest of shirts.</p>

          <p>(Quick shoutout to my brother for the way he's truly embodied my dream of perfect loose t-shirt adornment in the early 2000s.)</p>

          <p>In some ways it's too bad it took me so long to fall all the way for internet work. I certainly stuck my neck out that way over the years. Like, early echoes from my childhood: sneaky delights at the DOS prompt, initializing programs and traversing directory trees. WordPerfect. Word up. And so many free hours of AOL to chat with the whole world when I was a tween. 22/f here to chat. First gender plays, too. (Like now when I sit in the dark and pretend to be Kate Libby with that red leather zipped up tight over her boobies, munging JSON and bussing messages around.)</p>

          <p>And then I remember the mind explosion when I saw the ILOVEYOU worm corrupt a hard-drive in real-time during my internship with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.infopeace.org">InfoTechWarPeace project</a> in college. Wooed so hard by hacker smooches. (And falling a bit, too, for the dashing deutsche curator Franziska Nori).</p>

          <p>Then I touched down in the Yay Area in 2007, a year after Twitter launched and the SaaS bookmark service wars were really heating up. It was really nearly inevitable to jack in during those mythic times. Doors were open, man, and everytime I was at some networking function it was like "what can you do [on the computer]" and I'd be like, "well I've built a couple websites??" The way their eyes would just light up...</p>

          <p>(hand-wave life...)</p>

          <p>And so here we are. After repeated flirts and intellectual fancies with the web, I'm like ~7 years into a professional career designing, developing, and debugging useful web things; really doing all ends. I love it, I/O bound and hanging ten on the info highway. It's an existence of exponentializing ahas and obsessions and happy wtfs as you go deeper and follow the rhizomatic spread into things that empower so many things; the IOT of things! The implicit return? Any given day I'm caring more than I ever thought I would about a complex interplay of protocols and practices of cloudgineering (you might even say a...a MATRIX)</p>

          <p>Like higher order funcs and how functional is cool but like it feels awkward to say the word "pure" so much, how standardized RESTing and JSON API might make things a little easier, content-first development, empathetic teams, the OPTIONS verb and pre-flight, URLs being important and not losing the hyperlink (the interconnectdness of all the things dammit), how ad-driven web is a bit sad, passing state around in complex SPAs, the emotional side of technical debt, the emotional side of building software in general, checking these types in my JavaScripts, code reviews being important, battling imposter syndrome, archeologically deciphering the agile jargon, killing dead ends in UX, discovering the right metaphors to describe what I'm actually doing, studying Martin Fowler, Ellen Ullman, Duretti Hirpa, and more..., <code>git log --reverse --pretty=format:'%s (%an)'</code>, and recurse(...all_the_above).</p>

          <h2>Diaries and daydreams</h2>

          <p>Learning never stops in the software biz because the singularity must be hastened or something. Who knows exactly, but the reality is that under the choking ozone of Tesla fumes we rage forward with a nerdcore will/fantasy/hubris/<a href="https://medium.com/@girlziplocked/the-delusions-of-heroic-innovation-e6857b256ec6#.a8odjvg8t">delusional heroism</a> to stretch human meaning to the limit by augmentation or AI. Gordon Moore is forcing things along hella fast and you gotta keep up. (Or was it Fred Moore?)</p>

          <p>Many coders fold this learning back into code in the form of side projects; always the bricoleurs. Personally, I've found writing to be a satisfying outlet for working over the TILs. In many ways I write for me, and that's why some of my phrasing reads like e.e. cummings, or me after a couple pinots. But I do keep you in mind. Although I imagine you as someone who writes some code or helps build web products in some fashion. That summarily prefaced, here's a sample of my diary (with the whole rest of the lot <a href="https://medium.com/@internetross">here</a>):</p>
