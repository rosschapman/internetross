      <p>Hey all! <img class="shake" src="/assets/images/hello.png" height="25" style="position: relative; top: 3px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" alt="hand wave icon"> I'm Ross Chapman. I'm a software engineer with ten years experience working in web tech. 
      
      <p>I started as a developer in digital marketing and for the last 6+ years I've been working as an application engineer. I have built product in older and newer codebases, small and large, and am excited by the challenges attendant to each.

For 2+ years I've mentored  early-career software engineers both in a formal company setting, and as co-founder of a bi-monthly in-person gathering.  

      <p><strong>PROFESSIONAL UPDATE:</strong></p>

      <p>
       Due to COVID-19's calamitous effect on the live events industry, I was recently laid off from Eventbrite, where I helped build Enterprise B2B products for top tier venues and event promoters.  I'm proud to have contributed to the company's fastest growing revenue stream, doubling year over year for consecutive years. My crowning achievements were working on some of the biggest stories for Eventbrite product, Tiered Inventory, and Add-Ons . Tiered Inventory was a highly demanded feature to increase the sophistication of inventory management for reserved seating events. Add-Ons was a complete revamp and rewrite of our merchandising product, allowing Eventbrite to capitalize on non-admission inventory. Both generated millions on the platform. It was no small feat integrating these new data models into heavily indebted codebases. I'm looking forward to working with another team of curious learners at a medium to large company on similarly impactful core products.
      <p>

      <p>
        While the majority of my development experience has been focused on user interfaces, I'm primed for a user-facing full-stack role and willing to work with new and/or familiar languages and frameworks. Throughout my career I've frequently touched server code (Ruby on Rails, Django, SQL) and have been regularly involved in API design. I've also mentored in microservice development and Python.
      

      <p>
        At Eventbrite I worked in dozens of JavaScript codebases and received peer mentorship from some of the best in the business. I conquered a new stack (Backbone, React, the Flux pattern, Redux) and deepened my expertise in event-driven software to become a top contributor to new feature development and code quality efforts across the organization. The latter endeavor was unique and became a veritable master class in appropriately calibrating design consistency and autonomy across geos for a rapidly evolving system of people, process, and software.
       

      <p>
        These challenges inspired a lot of personal growth through technical investigations along a few different pillars of inquiry/implementation that I'm proud of. 
      
      <p><strong><em>Architecture</em></strong>: Orienting our React code toward control patterns like finite state machines and pull-vs-push to clarify abstractions to enforce <code>UI = fn(state)</code>, as well as socializing API documentation and shared data structures for service developers as cardinal contracts to increase flow for frontend engineers. 
      
      <p><strong><em>Communications</em></strong>: Inventing emoji-based semantics for Slack comms, credentialed training in Nonviolent Communication, and encoding decision-making through architectural design records (I'd really like to see ADRs extended more into version control alongside code artifacts!) and bi-monthly working groups. 
      
      <p><strong><em>Code</em></strong>: Expanding our toolset to meet the challenges of consistency and rigor, the boldest choice of which was embracing a static type system -- TypeScript -- and pioneering typing in our organization, as well as clarifying and establishing principles for "functional strength" in modules based on first principles (partially inspired by introductions to the FORTH programming language). 
         
     
      <p>
        Here are some thoughtful things my colleagues have graciously offered about working with me at Eventbrite: 
        <blockquote>
          It's rare that you come across someone as eager and excited to learn new things and refactor awkward codebases as Ross. I had the pleasure of working with Ross for almost two years at Eventbrite, collaborating on both team projects and org-level frontend engineering initiatives. I was always in awe of his genuine excitement for making our code and dev practices better - from more test coverage, documentation, new technologies, knowledge sharing, and reducing tech debt / amping up tech wealth. He brought both knowledge and humor to the team and the company / team that swoops him up will be a lucky one.<footer><small>- Melissa Roman, Senior Engineer</small></footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Ross is an impressive talented software engineer you can rely on. It was my pleasure to work with Ross for two years, in the same team at Eventbrite, building interesting and challenging web applications.  Heâ€™s a 100% team player who always inspired others to maintain high code quality, and never hesitated to bring up new ideas and approaches for the teamâ€™s productivity. Ross would be a valuable asset for any team looking for solid front-end engineers. As a former teammate, Ross earns my heartfelt recommendation. <footer><small>- JZ, Senior Engineer</small></footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Ross is a strong engineer with the ability to architect and implement complex frontend applications.  Ross cares deeply about the separations of concerns between frontend and backend: clean API. He is open minded, eager to learn, and not afraid of going through complex backend source codes to find his answers.  He is enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge and experience, and a good mentor to the other team members. <footer><small>- Shigeki Hirose, Distinguished Engineer</small></footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
         Not only is Ross deeply knowledgeable about the technologies he works with, but he also has a passion for sharing what he's learned with others around him, such as through mentoring, documentation, presentations, and proposals. His enthusiasm for technology, drive for learning, and thoroughness in designing solutions make him a great engineer to work with. In addition to being a strong engineer, Ross brings a high level of energy to the team and is just fun to be around!<footer><small>- Annie He, Senior Engineer</small></footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
         I had the privilege of managing Ross.  He's a dedicated engineer and always tackles challenges with an open mind and creates space for his colleagues to think about the design and implementation of features.  He's an expert in JS, React, Redux, and quickly picked up Typescript.   He shares knowledge constantly within and beyond his team, and mentors others.  He collaborates well with backend engineers and isn't afraid to ask for what he needs.  I would certainly work with Ross again.<footer><small>- Julia Hu, Engineering Manager</small></footer>
