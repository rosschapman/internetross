        My name is Ross Chapman. I'm a product-focused software engineer with an
        interest in building livable codebases with people from diverse
        backgrounds. Welcome to my professional web portal ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

      <p>
        Brief career history: In 2010 I started out as a website manager in
        digital marketing. In 2014 I became a web application engineer. That's
        about 10 years doing internet-y things! During that time I've worked in
        startups from series A to IPO, and have been equally excited to work on
        teams large and small.

        engineers both in a formal company setting, as co-founder of a
        bi-monthly in-person gathering, and most recently with the summer 2020
        cohort of <a href="https://codecooperative.org/">Code Cooperative</a>.
