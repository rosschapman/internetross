<p>My portfolio site was basically non-existent for the past few years while I travailed earnestly to keep pace with the hyper-growth at <a href="http://zendesk.com">Zendesk</a> pushing pixels for a brilliant marketing machine and managing production of their corporate website.  But since my <a href="http://internetross.me/#blog/bye-zendesk">farewell</a> a month ago I&#39;ve finally accrued some free time to reinvent and rebrand my digital self at a new online home, internetross.me, and role-play some technical fantasies.  I love these dot.me addresses.  And yes, I would have staked a flag at ross.me or rosschapman.me if a random email company or my doppleganger in the UK didn&#39;t get there first.</p>

<p>In the past year I&#39;ve handled increasing project work that talks to RESTful APIs; which typically means, from my vantage, GETting data to populate <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/blog/consumerization-beautifully-simple-design">beautifully simple</a> front-ends. Endpoints and $.ajax.</p>

<p>So when I began to fantasize the databits and their attendant pixels for this website, I thought, <em>Hey Ross, lets continue our study in the richness of HTTP data transportation</em>. Also, I&#39;d been kinda itching to experiment with the <a href="http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">REST API</a> that WordPress.com had released April of last year.</p>

<p>Having developed WordPress themes for like 5 years I&#39;ve gotta say that the tangle of PHP and HTML is not the most elegant to scale, and at this point I&#39;m pretty much exhausted by it. Compared alongside newer publishing platforms like <a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> or <a href="https://brandcast.com/auth/login">Brandcast</a> that are solving architecture and admin problems by adding socket-y live previews and direct front-end template editing, WordPress.org feels like quite the clunkster. My hope was that the WP.com REST API would expose new lines of flight and fancy because posts as a JSON object implies I can choose a future-forward application structure like Backbone.js to handle the site armature.</p>

<p>As an advocate for Web Standards back in the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">day</a> and more recently <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss">OOCSS</a> as another needed (i)m(pr)ovement to separate skin from skeleton, I&#39;m pretty jazzed about SPAs and MV-patterned application frameworks as the next wave of popular website development. Even for small websites like this one.</p>

<p>In a sense, this website is a bridge - in the markup as well as philosophically. A bridge that connects my past experience wrangling WordPress.org with the near-future of AJAX-driven UX - which makes the web feel so blingin&#39;.  WordPress.com is purely a database and authoring tool now.  And the greatest advantage to approaching the redesign this way is that I can host the site on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>; nothing happens on the server. For better or worse at the moment.</p>

<p>So what you&#39;re reading right now is a piece of JSON retrieved via a Backbone.js fetch method that then instantiates a new view for the data based on a pre-defined data model. It&#39;s that new new. Or, REST is the new...black?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a deeper technical dive coming soon. Thanks for reading and stay tuned! :)</p>
