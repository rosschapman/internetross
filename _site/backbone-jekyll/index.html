<p>If you&#39;re one of the five web developers or recruiters who have looked at my website in the past couple months, you&#39;re undoubtedly noticing the look and feel of this thing is different.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because I just totally migrated my website from WordPress and Backbone.js to Jekyll.  </p>

<h2>v1.0.0: Bone of Back</h2>

<p>After leaving Zendesk behind in September, I also decided to leave behind a 5-year history of WordPress consulting and development and learn THE FUTURE OF THE WEB.  Most companies needing front-enders wanted experience with JavaScript MV-style/-patterned frameworks like Backbone.js, AngularJS, or Ember - JavaScript is really soaring wowwey! - so I decided to learn one of those.</p>

<p>The week before an interview I spirited through <a href="http://twitter.com/addyosmani">@addyosmani&#39;s</a> <a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/">book</a> and rebuilt my website using an API first approach, leveraging Backbone.js to fetch blogs from <a href="http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">WordPress.com&#39;s</a> JSON API.  I&#39;m not sure I had even digested the concept of MV* entirely before launching the redesign - partly because, as one will find, Backbone.js itself <a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/12/23/backbone-js-is-not-an-mvc-framework/">defies</a> easy classification into an MV-family. But it was an invaluable exercise to think about a web experience different from WordPress&#39; event-driven architecture - which in many ways, was all I really knew. </p>

<p>While this experiment was successful, I wasn&#39;t really building an app. The &quot;sans-reload&quot; UI was nice, but SEO was totally sacrificed. Also, my website, at its most glorious, wouldn&#39;t be much more than a text blog, so   </p>
