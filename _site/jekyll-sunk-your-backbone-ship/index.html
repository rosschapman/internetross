<p>If you&#39;re one of the five web developers or recruiters who have looked at my website in the past couple months, you&#39;re undoubtedly noticing the look and feel of this thing is different.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because I just totally migrated my website from WordPress and Backbone.js to Jekyll.  The design, which some colleagues told me was &quot;pretty good&quot;, was sacrificed - for now - while I get the architecture figured out and actually do some writing. </p>

<h2>v1.0.0: Bone of Back</h2>

<p>After leaving Zendesk behind in September, I also decided to leave behind a 5-year history of WordPress consulting and development and learn new stuff.  Most companies needing front-enders wanted experience with JavaScript MV-style/-patterned frameworks like Backbone.js, AngularJS, or Ember - JavaScript is really soaring wowwey! - so I decided to learn one of those.</p>

<p>The week before an interview I spirited through <a href="http://twitter.com/addyosmani">@addyosmani&#39;s</a> <a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/">book</a> and rebuilt my website using what might be called an &quot;API first&quot; approach, leveraging Backbone.js to fetch my blog datas from WordPress.com&#39;s <a href="http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">JSON API</a>, and then old friends HTML and CSS to help browsers render the payload.  Having jumped in the deep end, I&#39;m not sure I had even digested the concept of MV* entirely before launching the redesign - partly because, as one will find, Backbone.js itself <a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/12/23/backbone-js-is-not-an-mvc-framework/">defies</a> easy classification into an MV-family. But it was an invaluable exercise to practice a build that relied solely on the emerging stars of web tech (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) with a  framework designed to communicate with JSON APIs.  AND, of course, the greatest benefit of all of a site with no sides of server, I could deploy my site easily to Github pages - which is cool because people can look at your code.  </p>

<p>While this experiment was successful, I wasn&#39;t really interested in dazzling my &quot;users&quot; with a single page app. The &quot;sans-reload&quot; UI was nice, but at the most I needed a website that could display some text and images in a weblog - like a Typepad thingy. Also, SEO is completely sacrificed with a JavaScript framework (I know, I know, there are ways around it).  But I wouldn&#39;t want to deprive my 5 or so fans - well, my mom at least - from discovering me on the web while searching for my name or &quot;random front-end developers who blog about shit everyone knows already.&quot;</p>
