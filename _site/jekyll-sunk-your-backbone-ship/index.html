<p>If you&#39;re one of the five web developers or recruiters who have looked at my website in the past couple months, you&#39;re undoubtedly noticing a new look and feel.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because I just migrated my website to Jekyll, a static-site generator built on ruby.  In the short term, the old site design, which some colleagues told me was &quot;pretty good&quot;, was sacrificed.  In the meantime, my beautiful prose will have to dazzle you.</p>

<p>So how did we get here?</p>

<h2>v1.0.0: Bone of Back</h2>

<p>After leaving Zendesk behind in September, I found most companies hiring front-enders were looking for experience with JavaScript MV-style/-patterned frameworks like Backbone.js, AngularJS, or Ember. So I decided to learn some of that new hot shit, and built a website.  Since my own website languished neglected for a few years, I would rebuild my own website.</p>

<p>The week before an interview with a hot, new, venture-backed startup out of a high-rise in downtown SF, I spirited through <a href="http://twitter.com/addyosmani">@addyosmani&#39;s</a> Backbone.js <a href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/">book</a> and rebuilt my website using what might be called an &quot;API first&quot; approach: a mini-JavaScript app leveraged Backbone.js to fetch my blog datas from WordPress.com&#39;s <a href="http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">JSON API</a>, and then old friends HTML and CSS helped browsers rendered the payload.  </p>

<p>Talk about dazzling.  In about 3 days I had a modern ajax-y single page app for a portfolio site - complete with a loading gif and picture of myself [touching my face] inside a circle. Web 2.0 certified.  </p>

<p>Having been building WordPress sites for like five years it was really refreshing to work with HTML decoupled from server logic.  Refreshing, in large part, because I didn&#39;t have to context-switch between PHP and JavaScript any longer, which is a bitch for remembering the right string methods.  And above all, because the site logic was completely client-side, I could easily deploy my site using Github Pages.  I love Github Pages.  Even having worked for a web host  </p>

<p>While this experiment was successful, I wasn&#39;t really interested in dazzling my &quot;users&quot; with a single page app. The sans-reload UI was silky, but at the most I needed a website that could display some text and images in a simple weblog. Backbone was a bit overkill. Also, SEO is completely sacrificed with a JavaScript framework (I know, I know, there are ways around it).  But I wouldn&#39;t want to deprive my 5 or so fans - well, my mom at least - from discovering me on the web while searching my name or &quot;random front-end developers who blog about shit everyone knows already.&quot;</p>

<h2>v2.0.0:</h2>

<p>Enter Jekyll.</p>

<p>Jekyll was an obvious choice for a couple reasons.  First, Github Pages uses Jekyll <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages">already</a>, so they understand how to server static sites that Jekyll compiles. Second, its built with ruby, and I am learning that.</p>

<p>As a side note, it&#39;s been a pleasure writing in Markdown. It&#39;s no wonder that projects like <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> are making an big splash. Even WordPress.com just <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/markdown/">released</a> native Markdown support.  </p>
